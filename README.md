# WCA-ELO-Ranking

A ELO rating system similar to the one FIDE uses for Chess. Serves as yet another way to rank the performance of cubers in a certain event (on top of Kinch Ranks and official WCA ranks). One main difference is that there does not seem to be enough rating inflation to prevent top cubers in the past who no longer compete to stay near the top (this could be a good or bad thing).
